/**
 * @maka/lab contracts — the walking-skeleton surface (issue #31).
 *
 * The lab treats an agent configuration as something testable: run a
 * `Config` against a `Task`, record what happened, score it. Keeping
 * `Config` and `Task` separable is the whole point — an experiment is
 * `Config × Task`.
 *
 * MVP scope only. Deliberately deferred as pure additions: a matrix /
 * compare layer, LLM/rule evaluators (MVP = command/test only), Docker
 * execution, network allowlist, `systemPrompt`/toolset overrides on
 * Config, and promoting these contracts into @maka/core once a second
 * consumer exists.
