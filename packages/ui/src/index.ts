// shared primitive UI primitives (copy/own from upstream primitive source). Each file is

// `markerVariants` / `streamVariants` / `toolVariants` / `LiveIndicator` are
// deliberately NOT re-exported here: they are internal styling tables / a
// single-consumer dot that the chat call sites apply via relative import, so
// keeping them off the package
// barrel preserves the governance goal — they stay renamable/removable without a
// public-API break. (Contrast `buttonVariants`, which IS public because it has
// external consumers.) `LiveIndicator` is exported to public only when the
// reasoning / composer / onboarding live dots actually migrate onto it — not
// speculatively before a second consumer exists.
//
// `previewVariants` (#332 PR4) IS re-exported: its file-diff parts have a second,
// cross-package consumer — `apps/desktop`'s `artifact-preview.tsx` — which is the
// promotion condition the off-barrel convention named, so the export is the rule.
