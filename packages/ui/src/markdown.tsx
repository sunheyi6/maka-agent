/**
 * Markdown rendering layer — eager entry.
 *
 * This module is intentionally lightweight: it only owns the
 * `MakaUriContext` (which the renderer installs once at the App root)
 * and a thin `Markdown` wrapper that `React.lazy`-loads the heavy
 * `react-markdown` + `remark-*` + `rehype-highlight` (highlight.js)
 * pipeline from `./markdown-body.js` on first use.
 *
 * Why the split: the markdown pipeline is by far the heaviest thing the
 * chat shell transitively imports, yet it's only needed once a message
 * actually renders. On a fresh launch (no active session) nothing ever
 * mounts `<Markdown>`, so forcing the browser to parse hundreds of KB
 * of highlight.js grammars before first paint was pure overhead. With
 * the lazy split, that code is parsed on demand the first time a
 * message appears, and cached for every subsequent render.
 *
 * The trust-boundary contract (URI allowlist, safe-scheme external
 * gate, broken-link inline errors) lives in `markdown-body.tsx`
 * alongside the `Markdown` body it overrides `react-markdown` with —
 * see that file for the routing rationale.
 *
 * PR-UI-LIB-EXTRACT-6 (WAWQAQ msg `510fef52`, round 7/10): pulled out
 * of `components.tsx`. `MakaUriContext` was already a public export
 * (the renderer's main.tsx provides the dispatcher), so `index.ts`
 * re-exports the new module to keep the `@maka/ui` surface identical.
 * `Markdown` / `MarkdownLink` / `CodeBlock` and the helper functions
 * remain package-private — only consumed within `@maka/ui`.

/**
 * PR-UI-RENDER-2 — context for the internal-link dispatcher.
 *
 * The desktop renderer installs the dispatcher once at the App root
 * (see `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx`). The dispatcher takes a
 * typed `MakaUriDest` and routes to whatever real navigation surface
 * the app uses (e.g. `setNavSelection({section: 'settings', tab: ...})`
 * for `kind: 'settings'`, or `composer.prefill(text)` for `kind:
 * 'compose'`). The Markdown link renderer never invokes navigation
 * directly — that's the dispatcher's job, and the dispatcher is the
 * single chokepoint to add observability / consent prompts later.
 *
 * Defined here (eager) rather than in `markdown-body.tsx` (lazy) so the
 * context identity is stable across the eager/lazy boundary — the
 * renderer installs the provider against THIS module's export, and the
 * lazy body reads it via `useContext(MakaUriContext)` imported back
 * from here.
