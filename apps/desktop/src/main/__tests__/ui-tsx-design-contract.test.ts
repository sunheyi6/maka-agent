/**
 * PR-FE-BUG-HUNT-12 (kenji aesthetic-audit reminder 4-6, finding #1):
 * `packages/ui/src/ui.tsx` is a motion / design contract blind spot.
 *
 * The PR-MOTION-TOKEN-CONVERGE-0 contract scans
 * `packages/ui/src/primitives/` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/`, but
 * NOT the aggregate UI re-export layer at `packages/ui/src/ui.tsx`.
 * That file inlines a bunch of Tailwind utility classes (z-40 / z-50 /
 * `backdrop-blur-sm` / `transition-[height]`) which would otherwise be
 * caught by the existing motion / z-index converge contracts.
 *
 * This test pins the EXACT set of design-system escape hatches that
 * currently exist in ui.tsx. Adding a new escape-hatch class without
 * updating the allowlist will fail this test. Removing an entry that
 * no longer exists also fails — preventing stale allowlist drift.
 *
 * The intent is NOT to remove these in this PR (that would touch Base
 * UI primitive wrappers and risk visual breakage). The intent is to
 * lock the perimeter so kenji / WAWQAQ can decide one at a time which
 * to tokenize, and so no NEW primitive PR can introduce a sixth or
 * seventh escape hatch without explicit acknowledgment.
